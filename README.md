## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical parameters. It uses a structured dataset to train machine learning models for classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Setup and Installation
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Heart_Disease_Prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook or Python scripts provided.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Heart_Disease_Data.csv`, which contains the following features:
- Age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, etc.

Example preview of the dataset:
```
age  sex  cp  trestbps  chol  fbs  restecg  thalach  exang  oldpeak  slope  \

```

## Implementation
### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand trends and relationships.

### Machine Learning Models
- Train-test split
- Cross-validation
- Models include logistic regression, decision trees, and others.

## Results
Results include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizations of confusion matrices and ROC curves.
